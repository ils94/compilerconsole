# Python Command Line

If you are like me, who separates various Python folders for different projects to maintain a clean Python installation with only the necessary modules, and you are tired of opening CMD and dragging both python.exe and pip.exe to install/uninstall modules, this Python program is for you.

# What does it do?

PCL makes it easier to perform Python commands on a Python installation folder. Simply pick the PATH to the Python installation and type in the commands in the Command Line entry.
